========

This project has the aspiration of providing a way to explore and learn about HyperMedia APIs and clients for those APIs.

## Inspiration
The inspiration comes from the [International Aerial Robotics Competition](http://iarc.angel-strike.com/) where the goal is for autonomous robot to accomplish a goal in a set period of time. The twist is that in this case the robot is only a program.

## The Plan
Provide a HyperMedia API for individuals to test their HyperMedia API Client bot against, to help in learning about consuming these types of APIs.

  1. Create a simple HyperMedia API to play the role of a maze
  2. Create a "bot" that is capable of mapping a HyperMedia API
  3. Add a "token" into a HyperMedia API to be searched for
  4. Create a "bot" that can find a path to a defined "token"
  5. Create more complex HyperMedia APIs to be searched
    1. Multiple routes to a token
    2. Route validation
    3. Hidden routes found by hashing algorythm

## Alternative
One alternative is to "flip" the challenge around so that the challenge provides a "bot" which will search through a HyperMedia API the individual provides; with variations as stated above.

## Etymology
The stately home [LongLeat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longleat) in England has on its ground a large puzzle maze which is the inspiration for the name of this project.

The intentional misspelling is a [Portmanteau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) which includes from the hacker community [leet (or l33t)](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=l33t).
